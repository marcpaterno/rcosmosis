Description: rcosmosis provides functions useful in the analysis of the
    output of CosmoSIS. CosmoSIS is a framework for structuring
    cosmological parameter estimation in a way that eases re-usability,
    debugging, verifiability, and code sharing in the form of modules
    contained in repositories for individuals, collaborations, and the
    community at large. CosmoSIS is available at
    https://bitbucket.org/joezuntz/cosmosis.
